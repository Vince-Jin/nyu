Hi!

Thank you so much for helping us run the analysis!

To run our scripts, please:
    1. Please check all these files are being stored in one folder:
        a. Analysis_10222024.do
        b. data_cleaning.do
        c. table1_fena.ado
        d. donor_st.do
        (***This folder will be called root folder in following information***)
    2. Under the root folder where the previous 4 files are stored, please create a new folder called "data",
        then place the "donor_live.dta" file under this newly created "data" file.
        a. now, the folder should has a structure of:
            --- (Folder To Store The Files)
                |
                |---data
                |    |
                |    |---donor_live.dta
                |
                |---Analysis_10222024.do
                |---data_cleaning.do
                |---table1_fena.ado
                |---donor_st.do
    3. Open the Analysis_10222024.do, and hit "Run" button.


Our script should create a folder called "Output" under the root folder. We would like to have this whole "output" folder as our desired outcomes.
Under the root folder, there should be also a new file called "analysis_log", which is the log of our analysis. We would also love to have this log file as well.

Thank you again for help us running the analysis!
Hope you have a great day and please take care.
